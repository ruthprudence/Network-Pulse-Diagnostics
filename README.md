## TCP Server-Client Example
This repository contains a simple TCP server-client example written in C#. The project demonstrates the fundamentals of network communication, data acquisition, and asynchronous programming, which are essential skills for a Junior Programmer Analyst position.

### Project Overview
The project consists of two main classes: TcpServer and TcpClientProgram. The TcpServer class represents a TCP server that listens for incoming connections and receives data from clients. The TcpClientProgram class represents a TCP client that connects to the server and sends data.

### Key Features
- **Asynchronous Programming**: The project uses asynchronous programming to handle incoming connections and data transfer. This approach ensures that the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously without blocking.
- **Data Acquisition**: The server receives data from clients and stores it in a string variable. This demonstrates the basic concept of data acquisition and storage.
- **Network Communication**: The project uses TCP sockets for network communication between the server and clients. This is a fundamental concept in network programming.
- **Error Handling**: The project includes basic error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks and exception handling.

### Running the Program
To run the program from the terminal, navigate to the project directory and execute the following Bash command:

```dotnet run```

This will start the server and client, and you should see the output in the console.

### Example Use Cases
- **Data Acquisition**: The server can be used to acquire data from multiple clients, which can be useful in various applications, such as IoT, monitoring systems, or data logging.
- **Real-time Communication**: The project demonstrates real-time communication between the server and clients, which is essential in applications that require immediate feedback or updates.

### Future Enhancements
- **Data Visualization**: The project can be enhanced to include data visualization tools, such as charts or graphs, to display the acquired data.
- **Security**: The project can be improved by adding security features, such as encryption or authentication, to ensure secure data transfer.

### Conclusion
This TCP server-client example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of network communication, data acquisition, and asynchronous programming. The project provides a solid foundation for further development and enhancement, making it an excellent starting point for a Junior Programmer Analyst position.
